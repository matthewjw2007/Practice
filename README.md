# Practice

This is a repository used to store a variety of practice programs to increase my understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms.

The majority of this practice is coming from following Colt Steele's Udemy course about DS&A, but instead of doing it in JavaScript I chose to do the challenges in Python to help increase my knowledge of Python and the problems presented in the course.
